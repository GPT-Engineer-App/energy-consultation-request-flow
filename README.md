# energy-consultation-request-flow

Build a multi-step onboarding flow for building owners to put in a request for energy consultation. 

The steps are: 

Step #1
Select address in search autocomplete

Step #2 
Request number of floors and size of the building in square meters

Step #3
Have the user describe biggest challenges when optimizing enegy use in your buulding (in free text) and mulit-select with common problems with old buildings

Step #4
thanks them for the details and ask them to insert name and email for them to contacted by our consultant team

This is a prototype but please sure you implement ALL the user stories, mocking and using dummy data if necesary. We will validate the prototype by running through EVERY SINGLE user story, so we need to be able to complete every single task.
